# THIS REPO IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED
This repository was made to open source the Forza Mods list, since their list was not downloadable in any capacity at the time. I am no longer able to update this list as I don't have gamepass any more and am not actively using Windows. If you would like to take over this repo, please let me know by emailing me at brydon@helium.email.

For any missing IDs, you may follow https://github.com/embedvr/FH4-Car-ID-List/issues/1#issuecomment-1306840568

# FH4-Car-ID-List
An open source Forza Horizon 4 Car ID list. Found in CSV, JSON, and XML format.

If you want to just see it on the web and don't need the files, use my airtable @  https://bit.ly/33LSfpu
## Why?
Konman @ Forza Mods blocked their Car ID list from being editable, so I parsed connections from Airtable and pulled JSON, cleaned out all the unnecessary items, then fixed up the obfuscated names.
### Missing Cars?
Let me know by making a Github Issue and I will work hard to add it!
